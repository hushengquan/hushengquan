- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hushengquan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in distributed storage systems and high performance frameworks
- ðŸŒ± I graduated from Beijing University of Science and Technology with a major in computer science.
- âœ¨ I'm currently working in backend development at Tencent Cloud Storage Department in Shenzhen.

Here are some interesting communities I'm involved in:

- [cloudwego hertz](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz) : Hertz is a high-usability, high-performance and high-extensibility Golang HTTP framework
- [cockroachdb pebble](https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble) : Pebble is a LevelDB/RocksDB inspired key-value store focused on performance and internal usage by CockroachDB
